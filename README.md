## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create, customize, and interpret various types of visualizations in **Matplotlib**. It is ideal for data scientists and analysts looking to present their data in a compelling way.

## 1. Bar Plot
Visualize categorical data using rectangular bars, with height representing the value.

## 2. Scatter Plot
Depicts relationships or distributions between two variables using data points.

## 3. Histogram Plot
Represents the distribution of data by grouping values into bins.

## 4. Pie Plot
Displays data in a circular format with slices representing parts of a whole.

## 5. Stem Plot
Shows discrete data points with stems extending from the baseline to each data point.

## 6. Box Plot
Provides a summary of a dataset through its quartiles, highlighting outliers.

## 7. Stack Plot
Displays the cumulative results of different datasets over time or categories.

## 8. Step Plot
Represents data with discrete steps, useful for time series or non-continuous data.

## 9. Linear Plot with Fill Between
A line plot that highlights areas under the curve, useful for showing ranges or differences.

## 10. Subplots and Savefig
Illustrates how to organize multiple plots in a single figure and save them as high-resolution images.

## 11. XTicks, XLim, Axis, and Annotations
Customization techniques for fine-tuning tick marks, axis limits, and adding annotations to graphs.
